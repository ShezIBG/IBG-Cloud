            <p class="description">A recent study by McKinsey asserts that prioritising innovation today is the key to unlocking post-crisis growth. Whilst global crises pose significant and often indeterminable dangers, they also present us with opportunity.</p>
            <p class="description"><span id="16">The COVID-19 pandemic has uprooted almost every aspect of our personal and professional lives and the evidence is there to suggest that the repercussions will continue to be felt as we move forward, with subsequent waves of infection and new viruses posing a very real threat. In a recent survey of more than 200 organisations across industries, over 90% of business owners and executives affirmed this sentiment and expect the fallout from COVID-19 to fundamentally alter the way they do business over the next five years. More than three quarters of respondents agreed that the crisis will also create significant new opportunities. With a return to what we consider normality looking all the more improbable, it’s crucial to begin building the foundations for post-crisis growth in order to remain competitive in the recovery period. Therein lies the choice we face as businesses today irrespective of our industry.</span></p>
